# 17C4IDOOBidding
A NodeJS telegram bot solution that allows for the bidding of Duty Dates at my army camp in 17C4I Bn. 

The bot will interface with google sheets, automatically calculating average points and inputting all those who signed extras etc in a permanent record on google sheets. Every month the current month's points will be archived on a seperate sheet with limited editing rights to protect point integrity.
